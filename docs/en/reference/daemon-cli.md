# Daemon CLI reference

Complete reference for the `obsidian-remote-server` binary. The plugin invokes this for you on every connect (see [[en/server/auto-deploy|Plugin auto-deploy]]); this page is for operators running it manually under systemd, in containers, or for debugging.

## Synopsis

```
obsidian-remote-server --vault-root=<path> [--socket=<path>] [--token-file=<path>] [--verbose]
obsidian-remote-server --version
```

## Flags

### Required

#### `--vault-root <path>`

Absolute path of the vault directory on this host. The daemon refuses to start if:

- The flag is missing or empty
- The path does not exist
- The path is not a directory

The daemon will reject any RPC operation whose resolved path escapes this root (`PathOutsideVault` error, code `-32015`).

```bash
obsidian-remote-server --vault-root=/home/me/notes
```

Relative paths are accepted but resolved to absolute via `filepath.Abs` at startup. Symlinks in the vault root path are followed.

### Optional

#### `--socket <path>`

Unix socket the daemon listens on. **Default: `<state-dir>/server.sock`** (state-dir is normally `~/.obsidian-remote/`).

The daemon:
1. Removes any existing file at this path (cleanup of dangling sockets from a crashed prior run)
2. Creates the parent directory with mode `0700` if missing
3. Binds the Unix socket
4. Chmods the socket to `0600` so only the daemon's user can connect

```bash
obsidian-remote-server --vault-root=/srv/vault --socket=/srv/vault-state/server.sock
```

#### `--token-file <path>`

Path the daemon writes its session token to at startup. **Default: `<state-dir>/token`**.

The token is 32 random bytes (hex-encoded → 64 chars), generated via `crypto/rand`. The file is written with mode `0600` and removed when the daemon exits cleanly. Plugins read this file via SFTP and present it on the `auth` RPC.

#### `--verbose`

Enable debug-level logging to **stderr** (slog text format). Without this, logging is discarded entirely (`io.Discard`).

The plugin's auto-deploy passes `--verbose` so the daemon's stderr ends up in `~/.obsidian-remote/server.log` (the spawn redirects stderr → that log file). For systemd-managed setups, decide based on whether you want noise in journalctl.

#### `--version`

Print the daemon version (one line) and exit `0`. Used by plugin-side diagnostics + script health checks. Bypasses all other flags.

```bash
obsidian-remote-server --version
# → 0.1.0
```

## State directory layout

When `--socket` and `--token-file` are not given, both default into `<state-dir>`. State-dir resolves to:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS / BSD | `$HOME/.obsidian-remote/` |
| Windows | (daemon doesn't run on native Windows; see [[en/server/overview\|Server overview]]) |

So a typical invocation with all defaults plants:

```
~/.obsidian-remote/
    server.sock     # the Unix socket the daemon listens on (mode 0600)
    token           # 32-byte hex token (mode 0600); auto-removed on clean exit
```

You can override either path independently — useful for multi-vault setups (one socket per vault on the same OS user; see [[en/server/multi-user|Multi-user hosting]]).

## Invocation patterns

### Manual smoke test

```bash
~/.obsidian-remote/server \
  --vault-root=$HOME/notes \
  --verbose \
  > ~/.obsidian-remote/server.log 2>&1 &
disown
```

After this, the plugin's reuse probe will attach without redeploying. To stop:

```bash
pkill -f obsidian-remote-server
```

### Same as the plugin's auto-deploy

```bash
nohup ~/.obsidian-remote/server \
  --vault-root=/home/pi/notes \
  --socket=/home/pi/.obsidian-remote/server.sock \
  --token-file=/home/pi/.obsidian-remote/token \
  --verbose \
  > /home/pi/.obsidian-remote/server.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Reverse-engineered from `ServerDeployer`. The plugin uses `nohup … < /dev/null &` so the daemon survives the SSH session that spawned it.

### Under systemd (per-user)

See the full unit at [[en/cookbook/systemd-managed-daemon|systemd-managed daemon]]. Key fragment:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/obsidian-remote-server \
  --vault-root=%h/notes \
  --socket=%h/.obsidian-remote/server.sock \
  --token-file=%h/.obsidian-remote/token \
  --verbose
```

`%h` expands to the user's home; lets one unit file work for any user via `systemctl --user`.

### Multi-vault on the same user

Different daemons need different sockets:

```bash
# Daemon for the work vault
~/.obsidian-remote/server \
  --vault-root=$HOME/work-notes \
  --socket=$HOME/.obsidian-remote/work.sock \
  --token-file=$HOME/.obsidian-remote/work.token &

# Daemon for the personal vault
~/.obsidian-remote/server \
  --vault-root=$HOME/personal-notes \
  --socket=$HOME/.obsidian-remote/personal.sock \
  --token-file=$HOME/.obsidian-remote/personal.token &
```

In the plugin profile for each, set the matching socket + token paths. See [[en/cookbook/multi-vault|multi-vault recipe]].

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Clean shutdown (SIGINT / SIGTERM received and listener drained, or `--version` printed) |
| `1` | Runtime error after startup (cannot bind socket, token write failed, vault root vanished, etc.) — message goes to stderr |
| `2` | Argument parse error (missing required flag, invalid value) — flag.ContinueOnError surfaces this |

## Signal handling

The daemon installs a SIGINT + SIGTERM handler that closes the listener (which unwinds `Serve`), removes the socket file + token file, then exits `0`. This is graceful shutdown.

`kill -9` (SIGKILL) skips the cleanup. The next daemon start will find the stale socket file at `<socket>` and the existing handler removes it before binding fresh — so a hard kill doesn't permanently jam the path.

## Environment variables

The daemon does **not** read any environment variables for configuration — all config goes through CLI flags. Things that DO affect the daemon implicitly:

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `HOME` | Determines the default state-dir (`$HOME/.obsidian-remote/`) when `--socket` / `--token-file` are not given |
| `TZ` | Affects `slog`'s timestamp output when `--verbose` is on; otherwise irrelevant |

The plugin's environment (Obsidian's `process.env`) is irrelevant to the daemon — they're separate processes on different hosts.

## What the daemon does NOT do

- **It does not detach from its terminal on its own.** Use `nohup … &` or run under systemd to background it. (Plugins do this for you.)
- **It does not rotate its own log file.** When run via the plugin, stdout+stderr are piped to `~/.obsidian-remote/server.log` and that file truncates only on daemon restart. Under systemd, journalctl handles retention.
- **It does not bind a TCP port.** Unix socket only — see [[en/server/firewall|Firewall, ports & NAT]].
- **It does not retry-on-fail.** Process-level supervision (systemd `Restart=on-failure`, the plugin's reuse-probe-then-redeploy fallback) handles that.
