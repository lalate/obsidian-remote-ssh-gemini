# Protocol evolution & versioning

How the wire protocol changes over time, what's safe vs breaking, and how clients should detect server capabilities.

## Two version axes

The wire has **two** versions:

| Axis | Field | Today | Bumps when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Protocol version** | `server.info.protocolVersion` (int) | `1` | A breaking change to existing methods (params/result shape, semantics, error codes) |
| **Capabilities** | `server.info.capabilities` (sorted string array) | All registered method names — currently 22 | A new method is added (non-breaking); an old method is removed (breaking) |

The protocol version is **the major-axis compatibility number**. Capabilities are the per-method feature flags within a protocol version.

## The strictness rule (today)

The plugin's `RpcConnection` checks `info.protocolVersion !== PROTOCOL_VERSION` (strict equality) and rejects with `ProtocolVersionTooOld (-32021)` on any mismatch. Per `plugin/src/transport/RpcConnection.ts:71`:

```typescript
if (info.protocolVersion !== PROTOCOL_VERSION) {
  // → fall through to redeploy or fail the connect
}
```

So today, **plugin and daemon must agree exactly on the protocol version**. There's no forward- or backward-compat negotiation. The `tryReuseExistingDaemon` probe relies on this: a version mismatch fails the handshake, the deploy fallback uploads the matching binary, version matches, connect succeeds. See [[en/operations/upgrading|Upgrading]] for the lifecycle view.

This is intentional pre-2.0 — the cost of a redeploy is small (~5 s) and the strictness avoids "subtly broken" runs where a client uses a method the daemon implements differently.

## What's a breaking change

Bumps `protocolVersion` (1 → 2):

- Renaming an existing method
- Removing a method
- Removing or renaming a field in an existing method's params or result
- Changing the type of a field (e.g. `mtime: number` → `mtime: string`)
- Changing semantics of an existing field (e.g. "mtime is unix-ms" → "mtime is unix-seconds")
- Changing the framing format (currently LSP-style `Content-Length: <N>\r\n\r\n`)
- Adding a required field to an existing method's params

## What's a non-breaking change (capabilities-gated)

Stays at `protocolVersion: 1`; new methods/fields advertised via `capabilities`:

- Adding a new method (e.g. a future `fs.search`) — added to `capabilities`; clients feature-detect by checking `capabilities.includes("fs.search")` before calling
- Adding an optional field to an existing method's params (server defaults if absent)
- Adding an optional field to an existing method's result (clients ignore unknown fields)
- Adding a new error code (clients should map unknown codes to a generic "unrecognized error" rather than crash)

## How clients should feature-detect

```typescript
const info = await rpc.call("server.info", {});
if (info.protocolVersion !== EXPECTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION) {
  // hard reject — strict-equality regime
  throw new Error("protocol version mismatch");
}
if (info.capabilities.includes("fs.thumbnail")) {
  // safe to call rpc.call("fs.thumbnail", ...)
}
```

The plugin uses this exact pattern for `fs.thumbnail` — added partway through the 0.4.x cycle. Older daemons without it would fail the capability check; the plugin falls back to `fs.readBinary` + client-side resize.

## Cross-version operability matrix

For protocol version 1 (the only one shipped to date):

| Client version | Daemon version | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0.X | 1.0.X (same) | Match — full speed (reuse probe attaches to running daemon) |
| 1.0.X | 1.0.Y (Y < X) | Mismatch on `info.version` string — reuse probe fails, plugin redeploys to bring daemon to 1.0.X |
| 1.0.X | 1.0.Y (Y > X) | Same flow — older client redeploys older binary over the newer one |
| 1.0.X | 2.0.X (future) | `protocolVersion 2 ≠ 1` → `ProtocolVersionTooOld` → redeploy fallback uploads the bundled (1.0.X-matching) daemon |

The reuse probe is the safety net. **Users do not see protocol drift errors** — they see a one-time ~5-second redeploy on the first connect after upgrading either side.

## When we'd bump to protocol 2

The pre-1.0 line saw zero breaking proto changes, and 1.x is committed to the same. Hypothetical triggers for a `protocolVersion 2`:

- A wire-format change (e.g. moving from JSON-RPC to gRPC for performance)
- A semantics change like "mtime now means content-modification time, not metadata-modification time" — semantically incompatible at the per-message level
- A protocol-level auth change (e.g. moving from per-startup token to per-call signed nonce)

When that happens:

1. Daemon supports both protocol versions for one release (returns `protocolVersion: 2` from new daemons; old clients see this and redeploy).
2. Plugin bundle gets updated to expect protocol 2.
3. Capabilities reset / re-curated as part of the 2.0 audit.

## Mobile / WSS transport (v2.0 milestone)

The mobile-relay plan ([[en/roadmap|tracked under #151]]) introduces a WSS transport alongside SSH. The transport is independent of the JSON-RPC protocol — same `auth` / `server.info` / `fs.*` methods, different framing + connection setup. The protocol version itself does **not** need to bump just to add a new transport.
