/**
 * Callback surface the `SftpDataAdapter` invokes after a
 * local-originated mutation succeeds, so the writer's own in-memory
 * vault model — `vault.fileMap` plus the `vault.trigger(...)` event
 * bus that File Explorer, MetadataCache and open editor tabs all
 * subscribe to — reflects the change without waiting for a
 * remote-driven echo.
 *
 * Issue #341: a title-bar rename calls `adapter.rename(old, new)`,
 * the remote op succeeds, but nothing fires `vault.trigger('rename')`
 * on the writer side, so the open editor tab stays bound to the
 * stale `TFile` and the next save targets a path that no longer
 * exists. On the SFTP transport there is no daemon `fs.watch` push
 * to recover from, so the divergence is permanent.
 *
 * `VaultModelBuilder` already maintains exactly this model for
 * remote-originated changes (driven by `FsChangeListener`); it
 * structurally satisfies this interface, so the writer path reuses
 * it. The interface lives in `adapter/` and is referenced only
 * structurally from `vault/`, so wiring it introduces no
 * adapter → vault import edge.
